Out of a passion for local punk and hardcore music backboned by DIY ethos and aspirations for an all-inclusive community, the company has since evolved into an eclectic indie rock label crossing genres, scenes and geographies. Ten years since the labels inception Run For Cover no longer lives out of owner Jeff Casazzas’ apartment, but instead houses an entire team inside of its Boston headquarters.")
  Label.create!(id: 2, name: "Secretly Canadian", description: "Secretly Canadian was started in 1996 by Chris and Ben Swanson, Eric Weddle, and Jonathan Cargill. The label's first two releases were a 7 inch by Songs: Ohia and a re-issue of an album by June Panic. Weddle later left to form label Family Vineyard, and the remaining trio were joined by Darius Van Arman in 1999. The label joined forces with Van Arman's Jagjaguwar, and the company has expanded rapidly since then.")
  Label.create!(id: 3, name: "Jagjaguwar", description: "In 1996, in Charlottesville, Virginia, friends of Darius Van Arman performed in a band under the moniker The Curious Digit. They had just recorded an album, but were not signed to a label. They had previously released a 7 inch record on the short-lived label Sentimental, which was co-run by Van Arman and a friend Dawson Prater (who later went on to start the Locust Music label out of Chicago). Sentimental became inactive when Prater moved away from Charlottesville. Working under the theory that some sort of label-affiliation would be better than self-releasing, Van Arman started Jagjaguwar.")
  Label.create!(id: 4, name: "Polyvinyl Records", description: "In 1994, while still in high school, Darcie and I founded Polyvinyl Press, a photocopied fanzine that mainly covered the DIY music scene we loved in the Champaign-Urbana, IL area and the greater Midwest. We sold zines at local record stores, at whatever ramshackle tables we could find in the back of basement shows, traded zines with other zine writers, and sent them out one-at-a-time via mailorder. We made countless friendships with bands. Our philosophy was to spread the word about bands we loved. Furthering that idea, we decided to release a split 7” with the third issue of the fanzine. Within a year we’d issued Braid’s first 7” Rainsnowmatch and a 20-band compilation called Direction—and in 1996 Polyvinyl Records was born.")

  Artist.create!(id: 2, name: "Turnover", genre: "Indie rock", biography: "Formed in 2009, Virginia Beach indie outfit Turnover initially emerged as an emo-pop act in the vein of bands like the Get Up Kids and Texas Is the Reason before transitioning into a more contemplative dream pop style. The quartet, made up of Casey and Austin Getz, Danny Dempsey, and Eric Soucy, jumped onto the scene in 2011 with a self-titled EP. A split single with Citizen followed the next year before the band would make its full-length debut in early 2013 with Magnolia on Run for Cover Records. Turnover's sophomore release, 2015's Peripheral Vision, represented a shift in style toward more melodic, dreamy indie rock. This tonal change was continued on their third LP, 2017's Good Nature, which, like its predecessor, was produced by Will Yip. While he appeared on Good Nature, guitarist Eric Soucy departed just prior to the album's August release.", imageUrl: "https://ohmyrocknessdotcom.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/band/image/59823/turnover.jpg", label_id: 1, likes: 0)

After several drinks, Granduciel and Vile discovered their shared fascination with the Bard of Minnesota, and began working on songs together. By 2005, the pair had enough material to launch a proper band, and the War on Drugs were born.", imageUrl: "https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2018/01/TWOD-2017-1516821815-640x427.jpg", label_id: 2, likes: 0)

The band's driving force, Ruban Nielson, is a psychedelic explorer with an experimental bent that was clear from the very first home-recorded Unknown Mortal Orchestra album, which paired his soaring guitar work with winsome melodies and trippy production. Working by himself and with collaborators that included his brother Kody, Nielson has taken the band on a journey touching on acoustic balladry, free jazz, disco, hard rock, and, on 2015's breakthrough album Multi-Love, freaky late-night R&B. No matter the style or setting, Nielson's dedication to exploration and expression make Unknown Mortal Orchestra one of the more interesting bands to come out of the 2010s neo-psych explosion.", imageUrl: "https://roundhouse-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Image/14808-fitandcrop-1200x681.jpg", label_id: 3, likes: 0)

Vernon's solo project took DeYarmond Edison's introspective, folky sound and embellished it with quirky orchestral touches that nodded to Sparklehorse and the drifty optimism of the Flaming Lips. Vernon moved back to Wisconsin the winter following DeYarmond's demise, setting up camp in a remote cabin in the north woods for three months. It was a hugely generative period for Vernon; writing and recording songs in 12-hour bursts, he found himself with a nine-song debut album by spring. He dubbed the project Bon Iver (an intentional misspelling of the French for 'good winter'), and the disc, For Emma, Forever Ago, was released on Jagjaguwar in early 2008.", imageUrl: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Bon_Iver%40Stockholm.jpg", label_id: 3, likes: 0)

Fronted by singer, songwriter, and guitarist Nai Palm, the band also features bassist Paul Bender, drummer Perrin Moss, and keyboardist Simon Mavin (also of the Bamboos). They self-released their short debut album, Tawk Tomahawk, in 2012, and gradually won support from a wide swath of taste-making DJs (such as Gilles Peterson) and fellow artists (beginning with Taylor McFerrin and later including Questlove and Erykah Badu). The band signed to Salaam Remi's Sony-distributed Flying Buddha label and re-released Tawk Tomahawk with a bonus track -- a version of album highlight 'Nakamarra' featuring a guest verse from Q-Tip. That track was nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best R&B Performance. In late 2014, Hiatus Kaiyote released a three-track preview of their second album; the first, 'By Fire', is a dizzying song partly inspired by the house-fire death of Palm's father. Choose Your Weapon, an expansive album twice the length of the band's debut, was issued on Flying Buddha in 2015 and debuted at number 11 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.
